## Build Setup

Here's how you run can see things in action:

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for server-side rendering
npm run build # build client bundle
npm run build-server # build server bundle

# Run express server to serve assets server-side
node server.js
```

Detailed description of everything can be found in the official [VueJS SSR Guide](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide).
